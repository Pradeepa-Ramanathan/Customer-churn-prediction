# Customer-churn-prediction


## 🚀 Project Overview
Customer churn refers to the loss of clients or subscribers. In today’s competitive environment, predicting churn is vital for maintaining profitability and customer satisfaction. This project builds a machine learning model to predict customer churn using demographic, account, and service-related data.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
The aim is to develop a classification model that forecasts whether a customer will leave the service. Accurate predictions enable proactive strategies to retain customers and reduce financial losses.

## 📁 Dataset Information
- **Source**: `Data_file`
- Contains demographic and service usage data.
- Variable descriptions can be found in `Data_Information.pdf`.

## 📦 Deliverables
- ✔️ A data exploration & preprocessing notebook/report  
- ✔️ A trained ML model for churn prediction  
- ✔️ Evaluation metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score  
- ✔️ Final report with insights and business implications

## ✅ Success Criteria
- Clear interpretation of model output to inform retention strategies  
- Accurate predictions on new/unseen data

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies
- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn  
- **IDE**: Jupyter Notebook (or compatible alternatives)


## 🧠 Methodology
- Data preprocessing: Handling missing values, encoding categoricals, scaling
- Train-test split to avoid overfitting
- Model selection: Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, etc.
- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV
- Evaluation using classification metrics

## 📈 Performance Metrics
- **Accuracy**
- **Precision**
- **Recall**
- **F1 Score**

## 📌 How to Run
